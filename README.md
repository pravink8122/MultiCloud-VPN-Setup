# MultiCloud-VPN-Setup
1. Introduction
Objective
This project focuses on deploying a multi-cloud infrastructure utilizing both Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). By distributing resources across two leading cloud providers, we achieve several objectives:
Enhanced Redundancy: Reduces the risk of downtime by leveraging multiple cloud environments.
Resource Optimization: Utilizes each platform's strengths to optimize resource allocation.
Resilience: Builds failover mechanisms, enhancing the infrastructure's resilience to regional or service-specific outages.
Scope
The multi-cloud infrastructure setup involves:
Networking Configurations: Establishing secure, isolated networks on both platforms.
Virtual Machine Deployment: Launching instances on GCP and AWS that can operate independently or in tandem.
Load Balancing and Failover: Setting up load balancers and DNS routing to direct traffic seamlessly between the two environments, ensuring uninterrupted service during outages.
Use Case Overview
This project is ideal for applications where high availability is a priority, especially in sectors like finance, e-commerce, or healthcare, where downtime could impact business continuity. This demonstration also serves as a guide for using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices for rapid deployment, scalability, and resource management in multi-cloud environments.
2. Tools and Technologies Used
Cloud Platforms
Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Provides a secure, global, and reliable infrastructure to support multi-cloud strategies. GCP's networking tools allow for effective VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) management, as well as firewall configurations, load balancing, and region-based deployments.
Amazon Web Services (AWS): Offers a broad suite of cloud services and a mature infrastructure. AWS was selected for its robust networking capabilities, IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles, and extensive range of instance types to handle various workloads.
Operating System
Linux: Chosen for its compatibility and support across GCP and AWS, Linux provides flexibility and security for deploying VMs. It's ideal for command-line operations and allows for easy configuration and automation.
Networking and Security
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Separate VPCs are established in GCP and AWS, creating isolated networking environments that reduce security risks. These VPCs are customized with subnets, IP ranges, and routing tables to connect resources effectively while maintaining isolation.
Firewall Rules: Configurations include setting up firewalls on both platforms to control inbound and outbound traffic. Each VPC’s firewall rules are designed to protect instances while allowing essential connections.
IAM Roles and Permissions: Access management is configured to ensure resources are secure. Roles are assigned with the principle of least privilege, allowing only necessary permissions for each component.
Other Requirements
Cloud Accounts: Active GCP and AWS accounts are essential, with proper billing information configured for each account.
Permissions: Ensure permissions are in place for VPC setup, instance deployment, and load balancer configuration on each platform.
3. Project Setup and Configuration
This section provides a step-by-step breakdown of the configuration process for deploying resources across GCP and AWS. Each step includes details on network and instance setup, ensuring consistency and connectivity between the two platforms.

Step 1: Account Setup
Create and Configure Cloud Accounts
GCP Setup: Log into the Google Cloud Console and set up billing. Enable the necessary APIs for network management, compute, and security.
AWS Setup: Log into the AWS Management Console, configure billing preferences, and ensure services like EC2, VPC, and IAM are accessible.
Permissions and IAM Configuration
Configure IAM roles and permissions for each account to limit access according to the principle of least privilege. For example:
GCP: Assign roles like Compute Admin and Network Admin to control access to VM and networking configurations.
AWS: Use IAM policies to restrict access to EC2, VPC, and other relevant services.

Step 2: Networking Configuration
GCP VPC Setup
Create a VPC within GCP and define its IP address range (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
Subnets: Create subnets within the VPC to organize resources by region or availability zones.
Firewall Rules: Set up firewall rules to allow necessary traffic, such as SSH (port 22) for remote management and HTTP/HTTPS for web applications.
AWS VPC Setup
In AWS, set up a VPC with a similar IP address range (e.g., 10.1.0.0/16) to maintain consistency.
Subnets: Define subnets within AWS regions for better resource segmentation.
Security Groups: Create security groups to control instance-level traffic, aligning them with the firewall rules established in GCP.
Routing and Connectivity
Configure routing tables in each VPC to manage traffic between subnets and instances.
Set up Internet Gateways to allow external traffic when needed, such as for load balancers.

Step 3: Virtual Machines
GCP VM Deployment
Deploy virtual machines in the defined GCP subnets. Key configurations include:
Instance Type: Select a machine type (e.g., e2-medium for general use).
Operating System: Choose Linux (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) as the base OS.
Networking: Attach each VM to the appropriate VPC subnet and assign a static IP if required.
AWS EC2 Instance Deployment
In AWS, launch EC2 instances in each subnet, ensuring they mirror the GCP VM specifications:
Instance Type: Choose an instance type like t3.micro or t2.medium for balance between cost and performance.
Security Group: Attach security groups to allow SSH, HTTP, and any additional required ports.
Connectivity Verification
Test connectivity by using SSH to access both GCP and AWS instances.
Ensure both instances are reachable through the defined firewall and security group settings.

Step 4: Load Balancing and Failover Configuration
Load Balancer Setup on GCP
In GCP, create a Load Balancer, attaching backend instances (GCP VMs) to distribute traffic.
Configure health checks to monitor instance health, ensuring the Load Balancer reroutes traffic during any downtime.
Load Balancer Setup on AWS
In AWS, set up an Elastic Load Balancer and attach EC2 instances as backend targets.
Similar to GCP, configure health checks to maintain service availability.
DNS Configuration for Failover
Use a DNS service (e.g., Route 53 in AWS or Cloud DNS in GCP) to configure domain-based routing between GCP and AWS instances.
Failover Routing: Set DNS records to redirect traffic to either GCP or AWS in case of service disruption on one platform.
5. Testing and Validation
This section outlines the testing procedures used to validate the setup across both GCP and AWS, ensuring connectivity, load balancing, and failover functionality.

Connectivity Check
Instance Accessibility
Use SSH to connect to instances in both GCP and AWS to verify they are online and accessible.
Confirm that firewall and security group configurations are correct, allowing only the designated ports (e.g., SSH, HTTP) for inbound and outbound traffic.
Testing Tip: For additional security validation, use network tools like ping and traceroute to check reachability across both platforms’ instances.
Inter-Instance Communication
Test inter-instance communication within each platform by attempting connections between instances in the same subnet and across different subnets.
If cross-platform communication is a requirement, verify any VPN or cross-cloud networking configurations to ensure connectivity between GCP and AWS instances.

Load Balancer Test
Traffic Distribution
Send test HTTP requests to the load balancer endpoints on both GCP and AWS to ensure they’re correctly distributing traffic across the backend instances.
Verify that requests are evenly or appropriately distributed according to the load balancer configuration (e.g., round-robin or weighted).
Health Check Validation
Temporarily disable or stop one instance in each platform to simulate an instance failure.
Monitor the load balancer's response; it should detect the unhealthy instance and redirect traffic to available instances, verifying the health check configurations.

Failover and DNS Routing Test
DNS Failover Configuration
Test the DNS routing by configuring failover policies for domain-based traffic between GCP and AWS.
Simulated Failure: Manually disable all instances in GCP or AWS to test whether DNS correctly redirects traffic to the operational platform.
Latency and Response Time Check
Measure response times when routing traffic between GCP and AWS. This test ensures that failover doesn’t introduce significant latency, maintaining an optimal user experience.
Tools: Use tools like curl or online latency checkers to log response times under different routing scenarios.



Troubleshooting Tips
Firewall/Security Group Errors: If instances are unreachable, double-check firewall rules (GCP) and security group configurations (AWS) to ensure they allow required traffic.
Load Balancer Timeout: If requests time out, verify that both load balancer configurations and health checks are properly set. A common issue is incorrect health check settings that prevent traffic from routing correctly.
DNS Failover Delay: DNS records may take time to propagate, depending on the Time-to-Live (TTL) settings. Ensure TTL is set appropriately for quicker failover.
6. Conclusion and Learnings

Outcome
This project successfully demonstrated the deployment of a resilient, multi-cloud infrastructure using GCP and AWS. Key outcomes include:
Cross-Platform Redundancy: By leveraging resources across both GCP and AWS, the setup achieved high availability and minimized the risk of complete service disruption.
Traffic Management: The use of load balancers and DNS-based failover allowed for efficient traffic distribution and seamless failover between platforms, ensuring continuous service availability.
Scalability: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles (if Terraform was used) enable easy scaling and replicating of the setup across different environments or regions as needed.
Challenges Faced
